For now, KievII implements some GUI element (ie labels, knobs, multiknobs, multi-band displays) and uses HTML5 canvas to draw them (but you can extend it to use whatever you want).
Currently supports element chaining (i.e. one element can change the value of one or more elements).
Look at a working demo (very early demo - ONLY GUI) @ http://bitterspring.net/webshifter/
