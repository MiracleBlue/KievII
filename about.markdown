KievII is developed by Jane's Conference (Cristiano Belloni), a developer based in [Bologna](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bologna).  

If you're interested in contacting me, my email is <a href="mailto:janesconference@bittespring.net">janesconference@bitterspring.net</a>.

This site is built using [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/tree/master), the 'blog-aware, static site generator'.  The theme was heavily inspired from tomafro.net [GitHub Project] (https://github.com/tomafro/tomafro.net) (thank you for opening its source, tomafro!) and date archives and tag pages are generated using a rake task.
